# ✨ Chatbot UI Improvement Requirement

## 📌 Project Context

I’m working on a chatbot application built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Ant Design**. The current UI (as shown in the attached screenshots) lacks a modern feel and doesn't deliver a great user experience.

The goal is to **redesign the chatbot layout and theme to match the look and feel of ChatGPT**, while also improving responsiveness and usability.

## 🎯 Key Requirements

### 1. **Font & Typography**
- Use modern, clean font styles similar to ChatGPT.
- Adjust font sizes appropriately for:
  - Title (`Airline Report Assistant`)
  - User messages
  - Bot responses
  - Input placeholder

---

### 2. **Chat Layout Redesign**
- Center or maximize the chat window area.
- Reduce excessive white space.
- Improve message flow:
  - Chat bubbles for user and bot
  - Distinct styling for user vs bot
  - Subtle background and border radius
- Add entry animations for messages (optional but nice to have)

---

### 3. **Left Sidebar - Theme Panel Improvements**
- Replace basic color blocks with modern card-style theme options or toggle buttons.
- Add:
  - Hover/focus states
  - Labels/icons for clarity
- Make sidebar responsive or collapsible

---

### 4. **Responsiveness**
- Ensure proper layout across:
  - Desktop
  - Tablet
  - Mobile
- Keep chat input and recent conversations accessible and properly sized on all screens

---

### 5. **Chat Input Bar**
- Rounded input box with padding (inspired by ChatGPT)
- Clear “Send” button with hover effect
- Subtle placeholder text (e.g., *"Ask about airline reports, schedules, or analytics..."*)

---

### 6. **Theme Customization (Advanced Option)**
- Introduce a card layout or modal popup to switch themes
- Light/dark mode support with defined color palettes
- Live theme previews in selection area

---

## 🚫 Restrictions
- **Tailwind CSS is not allowed**
  - Do not include Tailwind or any related configurations
  - Tailwind packages should not appear in `package.json`

---

## 📦 Suggested Tools/Libraries (Optional)
- For animations: `framer-motion`
- For custom styling: `styled-components` or `@emotion/react`
- For icons: `@ant-design/icons` or `lucide-react`
